Let's explore my top CliftonStrengths themes. The first time I took this assessment the majority of my strengthd reflected that I was in a time period of my life where I focused on external validation. Now, after graduating college and developing my analytical technology career for four years, I find the themes below truly resonate with the unique perspective I bring to my professional work.

> Invented by Don Clifton, the CliftonStrengths assessment uncovers your unique rank order of 34 CliftonStrengths themes. Your CliftonStrengths themes are your talent DNA. They explain the ways you most naturally think, feel and behave.

The real benefit of understanding these themes, is through application of these strengths to accomplish your goals. For example, I used these strengths to find, interview amd land my last two roles in Technology Risk Management. In addition to the broader strength characteristicsc, I also distinguished how these strengths apply  to my work. Reflexivly, I ahve also been driven towards work that aligns even more closely with the skills I excell and, and would like to strengthen below.

## ADAPTABILITY | Relationship Building
- Effectively manages ambiguity and approaches changes in routines, rules, and/or plans with flexibility.

As a Cyber Security Risk Managment professional, it's important to be able to model our world and understanding today, as well as constructing processes that can adapt quickly when our threats change. Technology workers are well versed in the "agile" mindset, tenants including, setting measurable goals, failing fast and testing often and early. Living in the space between technical expertise and regulatory expertise, as a risk management professional Ive benefited from adapting the clunkyrisk managemnt lief cycle into agile bits and pieces that can be picked off over 2 week sprints rather than quarterly projects and goals. 

## ACHIEVER | Executing
- Exceeding expectations and reaching goals spurs diligent work ethic with even greater purpose.
- Puts a lot of effort into telling a story. Strives to amuse, entertain, and inform audience. 
- Enjoys partnering with individuals who share a strong work ethic. 

As a Consultant I am empowered to set and achieve benchmarks of success. These milestones can be ambiguous, but typically involve analytical or stakeholder engagement activities such as data visualizations, risk modeling, interviewing and focus group discussions. I thrive in an enviornment where I am expected to work independently, and where I have the flexibility to toggle betweeen projects that serve a similar goal or program.

## FUTURISTIC | Strategic Thinking
- Self-assured in intelligence, imagination, and resourcefulness needed to achieve goals.
- Reaches goals by seeking out opportunities to showcase innovation and utilize strengths. 
- Considering upgrades and enhancements motivates excellence. 
- Helps people see the opportunities and possibilities that await them in the future.

Flexing my futuristic  mindset is an essential skills for risk quantification and cyber security. In risk quantification I'm playing with the mathematics of probability distributions, and predicting the most likely threats and impacts to our business. Cyber requires both the curiosity to continually learn up-and-coming adversary techniqiues, but also the humility and creativity to seach for gaps, flaws, and baseless assumptions in our own risk model and understanding. 

## HARMONY | Relationship Building
- Brings a spirit of friendliness and personal warmth to team.
- Easily establishes a rapport with others with personable style and optimistic attitude.
