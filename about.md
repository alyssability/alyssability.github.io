**I tinker with math problems to decompress, write poetry when I'm speechless, and avoid complacency like the plague.**

**I am pursuing a career in developing and exploring the intersection between information, language, technology and humanity.**

**In my role as an IT Risk Management Specialist**, I am excited by the challenge of eliciting & communicating risk-driven insights such that our CISO & their cabinet can make informed decisions about strategic priorities based upon the residual risk within our complex enterprise. I enjoy grappling with simulations, technology risks, and contributing to a new technology industry by, and for humanity.

**My passions for leadership and asking tough questions have driven me to unique adventures.** I grew up in a city blessed in every way except when it comes to lake effect snow. In 2012 I left suburbia to explore Israel with the Nesiya Institute. I anticipated the arduous task of discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with diverse peers, but I wanted to encounter questions bigger than my landscaped backyard.

This experience sparked my interest in social justice and globalization. It motivated me to study abroad with SIT as an International Honors Scholar to appreciate and constructively criticize my city, culture, and assumptions. I practiced asking the right questions and adapting to questioning everything. **My academic experiences have fueled my enthusiasm for inspiring and shifting the technology industry towards a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment.**
